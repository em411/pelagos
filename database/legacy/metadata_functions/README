The decision was made to remove the xpath functionality from the
metadata_view, instead adding columns to the metadata table and creating
triggers to populate the columns on INSERT (because the view suffered severe
performance penalties, but now each INSERT takes a tad longer due to the XPATH
functions, but not noticeably so). As a result of this decision, all existing
metadata table instances were left with NULL in these new columns. In order to
"back-populate" those columns functions were created to extract each individual
attribute from the existing XML. Applying those functions to an UPDATE
statement would populate each row's new attributes. This directory contains the
scripts to create those functions, and a script that makes use of them. The
latter script then DROPs the no-longer necessary functions.

To use these scripts, simply run each of the make_* scripts, then run the
do_updates.sql script. There is no particular order in which the make scripts
will need to be run, but all must be run prior to the do_updates script (since
this is a one-time operation in a controlled environment, no real error
trapping has been implemented).
