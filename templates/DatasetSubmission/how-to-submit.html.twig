                <p>
                    The following 2 step process is used to submit datasets to the GRIIDC system. This
                    process includes data management planning, dataset documentation, and the creation of a
                    dataset citation device. You may be prompted to log in to the GRIIDC System before
                    accessing the following submission tools.
                </p>
                <p>

                        <strong>Step 1: Identify the Dataset</strong>
                    </a>
                    <br>
                    The GRIIDC Dataset Information Form (DIF) is a data management planning tool for both
                    researchers and GRIIDC. DIFs should be completed soon after receiving funding, during
                    project planning and organization. Information provided in the DIF will be used to
                    pre-populate fields during dataset submission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="{{ path('pelagos_app_ui_datasetsubmission_default') }}" target="_blank">
                        <strong>Step 2: Submit the Dataset</strong>
                    </a>
                    <br>
                    Once your dataset has been collected or generated, you can submit it directly to GRIIDC
                    through GRIIDC Dataset Submission. Alternatively, if there is a disciplinary specific
                    national data archive (e.g., NCBI GenBank) where the data is submitted and publicly
                    available, the dataset's location can be provided to GRIIDC during dataset submission.
